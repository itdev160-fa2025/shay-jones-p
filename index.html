    <h1>WNBA Basketball: The Rise of Fans</h1>
    <p> The Women's National Basketball Association also known as the WNBA has seen a significant increase in its fanbase over the years.
        Prior to 2020, it was illegal for college athletes to get reimburse with money while playing. Since then, college athletes are now allowed 
        to get money for the likeness and sponsorships. For example, the two biggest rookies of college basketball, Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, have found 
        real fans due to being able to get sponsorships. Both rookies, came into college with huge fansbase and sponsorships like Reebok and Nike. Most athletes in the past 
        were allowed to get sponsorships when they went pro. This shift has not only changed college athletes but the professional aspect too.
